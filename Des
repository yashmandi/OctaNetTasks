Completed the First Task, an ATM Interface project as part of my ongoing learning journey at OctaNet Services Pvt Ltd. ðŸ› 

Implemented a console-based ATM application with features like Transactions History, Withdrawal, Deposit, Transfer, and Quit.

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of Java and refine my skills in building practical applications. A big shoutout to the supportive coding community for their guidance!
